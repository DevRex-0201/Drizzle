## Raw queries execution

If you have some complex queries to execute and drizzle-orm can't handle them yet, you can use the `db.execute` method to execute raw queries.

```typescript copy
// it will automatically run a parametrized query!
const res: MySqlQueryResult<{ id: number; name: string }> = await db.execute<
  { id: number; name: string }
>(sql`select * from ${users} where ${users.id} = ${userId}`);
```
